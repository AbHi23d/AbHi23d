# 👋 Hi, I’m Abhi

I’m an analytics professional with a strong foundation in SQL, Python, and Business Intelligence, focused on helping teams make better, faster decisions. I work end to end across the analytics lifecycle—from data extraction and transformation to analysis, visualization, and decision support—turning complex, messy datasets into clear, reliable, stakeholder-focused insights that drive performance tracking, risk-based decisions, and operational outcomes across business, operational, and applied healthcare contexts.

I prioritize analysis that actually gets used, valuing rigor, clarity, and real-world impact over flashy models and bring this mindset to analytics problems across business, operations, and applied healthcare contexts, working end to end—from data extraction and transformation to analysis, visualization, and decision support.

## 📌 Featured Projects
### ⚽ Football Analytics & Prediction System
- Analyzed **3,800+ Premier League matches** across 10 seasons using SQL and Python  
- Engineered performance indicators (ELO, form, momentum) to capture team dynamics  
- Built predictive models with strict temporal validation  
- Delivered insights through **Tableau and Streamlit dashboards** for comparative analysis

### ❤️ Cardiovascular Risk Analysis
- Analyzed **319K patient records** to support preventive screening and risk stratification  
- Evaluated recall–precision trade-offs to minimize missed high-risk cases  
- Designed interpretable metrics (e.g., patients flagged per 1,000) aligned with operational constraints  
- Emphasized data quality, validation, and real-world feasibility

## 🧠 How I Think About Data
- Analysis should be **decision-oriented**, not output-oriented  
- Data quality and assumptions matter more than model complexity  
- Good analytics balances rigor, interpretability, and operational reality  
- **AI-assisted analytics** are valuable when they enhance—not replace—sound statistical thinking
